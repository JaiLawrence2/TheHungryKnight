# TheHungryKnight
It was a dark and stormy night that saw a very hungry and exhausted knight and his retinue of mounted men-at-arms enter the Hungry Knight Inn and Tavern worn down as the Hungry Knight and his mounted band were by the end of a hard day riding across the country-side on horse-back in response to the King’s Calling of the Banners.  The Hungry Knight and his party are eager to turn in for the night at your Inn with warm meals in their bellies at your tavern after having their tired but trusted warhorses seen to by the Hungry Knight Inn and Tavern’s attached stable.  As the Inn and Tavern keeper of this fine establishment, you decide to offer the hungry knight and his soldiers a selection of the finest food and drink you have as well as care you can provide if only to ensure the hungry knight doesn’t turn into the angry knight and have your fine establishment razed into the ground.  To that end, you decide to offer the Hungry Knight once he signs your Inn register book as many plates of Roast Pheasant, bowls Beef Stew, loafs of Fine Bread with cream, and assorted pieces of fruit freshly collected from the fields as well as any number of cups of Mead, Ale, and Wine as the Knight and his band requests to break their day long fast.  Naturally, since the Hungry Knight’s warband is here on the King’s business, you are permitted by the King’s law to charge the Crown whatever the Hungry Knight and his men owe to your fine establishment for services rendered so at the least there should be no need to fear incurring the Hungry Knight’s wrath at having to pay good coin to an “up-jumped semi-literate peasant” like you.
